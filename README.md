# Food-order-application
Full Stack Food Ordering Project with React (Next.js)

This is a full-stack food ordering application built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and several other technologies. It allows users to browse and order food from various restaurants. The project includes features like responsive transitions, authentication, state management, form control, validation, and an admin panel for restaurant owners. The application also includes a MongoDB database for data storage and a custom API for handling requests. Passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt algorithm.
